Objective of this project is to create a predictive modeling for wildfires in the Northen California regions.

To run the project, basically you need to do these steps:
1. Download the 2 CSV files that contains the dataset for feature values
2. Git clone the SVM algorithm
3. Run it and you should be able to see the results

Future improvements/ works to be done: 
1. Analyse the TPs, FPs, TNs, and FNs, evaluate why are some of the positives predicted false and vice versa
2. Analyze the distribution of the feature values. May influence the results
